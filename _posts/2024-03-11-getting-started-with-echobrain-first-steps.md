### Step 2: Unlock Your EchoBrain Toolkit
Inside your EchoBrain dashboard lies the key to connecting EchoBrain with your online shop – your API keys and unique shop ID.

### Step 3: Integrate EchoBrain with Your Shop
With your API keys and shop ID in hand, it's time to bridge your shop with EchoBrain. If you're using Fourthwall or a similar platform, locate the EchoBrain app within your shop's dashboard and input the information you retrieved earlier. Connecting EchoBrain is as simple as clicking "Connect". This seamless integration is the first step in bringing the power of customer reviews and social proof to your storefront.

### Step 4: Customize Your Customer Experience
EchoBrain doesn't just collect reviews; it transforms them into an integral part of your brand's narrative. Through your Fourthwall shop's Theme Editor, you can inject EchoBrain's script to start the magic. This script is more than just code; it's the gateway to displaying authentic customer reviews, complete with images and ratings, right on your product pages.

But EchoBrain's customization capabilities don't end there. Dive into your EchoBrain dashboard to personalize everything from the aesthetic of published reviews to the strategic placement of these testimonials on your site. EchoBrain ensures that every review not only looks like a natural part of your store but also enhances the shopper's journey.
