Let's chat about how you can make EchoBrain reviews adopt your brand’s essence with some simple tweaks. Let’s get started!

## Making EchoBrain Look Like Your Shop
When you first hop into EchoBrain’s dashboard, it already knows your shop's style. It takes a peek at your shop and matches things up. Want to switch things up a bit? No problem. You can change the logo anytime in the dashboard – just a few clicks and you're set.

## Your Brand’s Colors
EchoBrain gets its color vibe from your store too, but hey, we all like options, right? If you’re feeling creative, splash on some new colors. Change the primary color, background, text – even the button shapes! And if you know a bit of CSS, you can get fancy and add your own styling. It’s like choosing the perfect outfit for your online shop.

## Where Do You Want Your Reviews?
Your reviews are like little stars – let’s put them center stage. You can place them wherever you like on your site with some CSS tricks. It’s a bit like deciding where to hang pictures in your shop. Not sure about CSS? No worries, there's help for that too.

## Widget Wonders
Widgets are like little robots that show off your reviews. You can tell them how many reviews to show or how many customer photos to display. Want to keep showing reviews one after another? Turn on the infinite popup. No reviews yet? You can decide if you want to show an empty space or not.

## The Perfect Thank You Email
When customers buy from you, EchoBrain sends a nice email asking for their thoughts. You can make that email look just the way you want. Add your personal touch to it, and it'll feel like a thank you note from an old friend.

## Coupons for Reviews
Everyone loves a good deal, right? With EchoBrain, you can offer discount codes to your customers who leave reviews. You can have a special code for each customer or one code that everyone can use. It's a sweet way to say thanks!
